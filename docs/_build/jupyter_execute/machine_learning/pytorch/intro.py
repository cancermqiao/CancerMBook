# Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model
# parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to a complete ML workflow
# implemented in PyTorch, with links to learn more about each of these concepts.
# 
# We'll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs
# to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker,
# Bag, or Ankle boot.
# 
# `This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.`
# 
# 
# ## Running the Tutorial Code
# You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:
# 
# - **In the cloud**: This is the easiest way to get started! Each section has a "Run in Microsoft Learn" link at the top, which opens an integrated notebook in Microsoft Learn with the code in a fully-hosted environment.
# - **Locally**: This option requires you to setup PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine ([installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.

# 
# ## How to Use this Guide
# If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the [0. QuickStart](./quickstart_tutorial.ipynb) first to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.
# 
# If you're new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first section of our step-by-step guide: [1. Tensors](./tensorqs_tutorial.ipynb).
